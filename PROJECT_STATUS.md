## üéØ Run of Show

### Quick Demo (2 minutes)

1. **Open:** http://localhost:3000
2. **Click "Create Workspace"** ‚Üí Enter name
3. **Click "Create Project"**
4. **Click "Complete Task" 3 times** (see progress bar!)
5. **Click "Send Invite"**
6. **Click "View Dashboard"** ‚Üí See activation rate

### Verify in PostHog EU

1. Go to **posthog.com** ‚Üí Your Project
2. **Data ‚Üí Groups** ‚Üí Should see your workspace
3. **Live Events** ‚Üí Should see all 6 events with `groups: { workspace }`
4. **Groups ‚Üí [Your Workspace]** ‚Üí All events associated

## üîç Failure Mode Diagnosis

### 1. "Nothing happens" / Events don't appear

**Check:**
- `.env.local` exists and has `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY` (starting with `phc_`)
- `POSTHOG_HOST` is correct (EU: `https://eu.i.posthog.com`)
- Browser console: look for PostHog errors
- Network tab: check if `/capture/` requests returning 200

**Fix:** Restart server after changing `.env.local`

### 2. "Group not found" or events without groups

**Check:**
- Terminal logs show "Group identify response: 200"
- `bindWorkspace()` called AFTER workspace creation
- Groups created BEFORE other events

**Fix:** Ensure workspace creation completes before other actions

### 3. Dashboard shows 0 workspaces

**Check:**
- Workspace created via `/api/workspace` (not old hardcoded `ws_2001`)
- Server restarted (in-memory stats reset)
- Dashboard has auto-refresh every 5 seconds

**Fix:** Create workspace through onboarding UI, wait for refresh
